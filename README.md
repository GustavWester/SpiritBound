## About the Game
**SpiritBound** is a top-down bullet hell game created as a semester project for the **Game Design program (Spring 2024)** at **Nordfyns Højskole**.  
The game explores the **corruption of the højskole spirit**, taking place in a world inspired by the culture and atmosphere at Nordfyns Højskole.

As the player restores the højskole spirit, they influence the world around them, watching it gradually transform for the better.  
The game features multiple **boss battles**, each inspired by teachers' personalities and their *anti-versions*, adding humor, symbolism, and narrative depth.
